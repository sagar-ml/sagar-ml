# 👋 Hi, I'm Sagar Wagh 
### AI/ML Application Engineer | Python | Data Analysis | Engineering ML Tools  

I'm a Mechanical Engineer transitioning into **AI/ML**, currently working as an **AI/ML Application Engineer**.  
I enjoy building simple, practical tools that combine **engineering data** with **machine learning** and **Python automation**.

---

## 🔥 What I'm Learning & Building
- Python for Data Analysis (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Machine Learning basics (EDA → Model → Evaluation)
- Power BI dashboards (exploring)
- CAD + Python automation (future: pycatia / engineering data workflows)
- Small, real-world ML utilities for engineering teams

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code  
- **Interests:** Power BI, Streamlit, CAD Automation using Python  

---

## 📌 My Current Projects
- **Python Practice Repo** — Learning exercises, examples, small utilities  
- **Data Cleaning Utilities** — Working on dropna/interpolate data-cleaning scripts  
- **Pandas Exploration Notebooks** — Handling NaN, interpolation, EDA  

*(More projects coming soon — I’m actively building!)*
